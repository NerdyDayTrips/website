Red, Blue or Fire Red and Leaf Green PokÃ©mon nerds rejoice â€” why not visit a thematic influence for Pallet Town / Masara Town (if you happened toâ€™ve played in Japanese) â€” and spend some time hunting for Kanto region pokelids ðŸ™‚

Be warned that the park is likely crowded with PokÃ©mon Go players farming the area for gyms and pokestops (if thatâ€™s still part of the gaming zeitgeist at time of reading ðŸ˜‚), curious nerds will benefit from careful planning if avoiding crowds is your vibe ðŸ˜›
