A lovely little museum with some interesting exhibits, including some vintage metro trains from the Ginza and Maranouchi lines. There are also some train simulators and a huge model train system that shows the metro, which periodically operates with a member of staff making announcements. You can also view the train's perspective on screens around the model. The entry gate to the museum is a nice touch.
