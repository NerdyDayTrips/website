A disused railway line that runs along (and very often across) the River Hamps. It's now a cycle track. Runs into the Peak District and has a pub at each end (about 9 miles apart).  Loads of things to see from a Geological perspective, and is very pretty too. Start at either Hulme End or Waterhouses (that's the postcode).
