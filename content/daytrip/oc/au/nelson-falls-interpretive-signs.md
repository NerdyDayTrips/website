For some reason, every interpretive panel on this short nature walk has a TARDIS symbol, and text explaining your journey through time to the Jurassic Era as if you’re flying the time machine and need to “stop your engines”.  If you’re from the mainland and driving this road you will underestimate the time it takes anyway, thanks to the mountainous roads, so choose this tourist stop if not all the others.
