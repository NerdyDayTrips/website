The Museum of the Great Southern precinct overlooks picturesque Mamang Koort / Princess Royal Harbour on the site of the first European permanent settlement in Western Australia (1826). Here you will find permanent and travelling exhibitions, a replica of the Brig Amity, pop-up artworks, public and educational programs, and information on the natural and social history of the region. The Museum shares the stories of the Menang Noongar people and the influence of Mokare, an intermediary who assisted European explorers in an unfamiliar environment. It also explores the region's unique landscapes, flora and fauna.
