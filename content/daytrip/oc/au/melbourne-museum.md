You like dinosaurs, right?  Enough said.  There's the *Dinosaur Walk* and the *Triceratops* exhibit.  Then the *600 Million Years Gallery* showing the history of Victoria through local fossils and displays.  And get even deeper into history with the *Dynamic Earth Gallery* highlighting the history of our planet's environment and looking to its future.

The *Forest Gallery* is a huge indoor piece of forest including birds and bugs with self-guided tour highlighting various parts of the Victorian biome.  This is a living gallery so come back at different times of the year as the exhibit changes through the seasons.

The *Melbourne Gallery* allows you to look back at how our city was, how the people of earlier times lived and how it's changed and grown since colonisation, while *First People's Gallery* highlights the First Nation's heritage in and around Naarm and surrounding Country.  You'll hear the voices of the First People hear many of their stories.

And that's some of the regular exhibits, there's exhibition spaces that bring new exhibits every few months, check out the website to see what's on.

There's so much to keep kids interested, but if they need a break there's places to take time out in the hands-on *Children's Gallery*, and rest, eat and play in the *Children's Garden*.  The garden is just a nice place to sit with coffee even if you don't have kids.

And to top if off IMAX and the Exhibition Buildings and nearby Exhibition Gardens are on the same site.
