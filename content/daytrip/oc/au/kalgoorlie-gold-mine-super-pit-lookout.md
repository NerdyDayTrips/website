One of the most popular attractions in the Goldfields, the Super Pit Lookout draws thousands of locals and tourists each year.

The pit is approx 3.5km long, and 1.5km wide, and with a depth of around 600 metres - this is one seriously big hole in the ground.

The opportunity to view a working mine site in action and the chance of watching a blast keep the Lookout firmly on the local must do list.


The Super Pit Lookout is open 7am to 7pm daily.
