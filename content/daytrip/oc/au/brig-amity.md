Walk up the gangplank and step back in time aboard Brig Amity to find out what life was like aboard a convict ship in 1826. 

As you explore the ship, listen to the story of Amity's perilous 6 week journey from Sydney to King George Sound to establish the first European settlement on the west coast of Australia.

Discover the sights and sounds below deck that were encountered by those aboard as they headed for unknown lands, sharing space with the shipâ€™s crew, 23 convicts, 21 soldiers and enough domestic animals, food crops and building materials to start the small, remote outpost.

The informative and helpful volunteer guides will assist you to navigate your visit and will be happy to answer any questions you may have. They can also tell you other interesting things to do and see at Museum of the Great Southern, as well as in Albany.

The Amity is part of the Museum of the Great Southern site.
