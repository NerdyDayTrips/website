The WA Shipwrecks Museum in Fremantle is a world-renowned institution dedicated to preserving and interpreting Western Australia’s maritime heritage, particularly its shipwrecks and relics. It’s housed in the historic Commissariat buildings—some of the earliest structures built using convict labour—where its galleries showcase centuries of perilous sea journeys, from European exploration to dramatic wrecks like the Batavia. 

Beyond its exhibitions, the museum plays a key role in maritime archaeology and shipwreck conservation under federal legislation. It not only displays artefacts—like original timbers, rare objects, and recovered machinery—but also actively manages and researches historic wrecks off WA’s coast, striving to bring stories from the deep into the public eye.
