The Old Perth Boys School, located at 139 St Georges Terrace, Perth, Western Australia, is the earliest government school building in Western Australia.

The single-storey limestone (sandstone) building was designed by William Ayshford Sanford (as Colonial Secretary) in around 1852 (construction began around 1853 and was completed in 1854), and is a good example of the colonial / Gothic-revival style used in mid-nineteenth century Perth.

The building is owned by the National Trust of WA and currently leased to Curtin University, which uses it for events, exhibitions and university-activities rather than as a public museum. It is not generally open to the public as a regular tourist site.

Nestled in the heart of the city, it is striking to see this little 19th-century stone building amid the modern skyscrapers along St Georges Terrace.

If you go midweek, Brookfield place (Large Plaza around the base of several large office towers) directly to the south is open, and there are several food and drink options available.
