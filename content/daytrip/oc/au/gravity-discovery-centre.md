Not much to see during the day, they do have a small science interactive display that is interesting. However, there are two times you need to visit - nights of a full moon, and nights of a new moon! Their evening events are super informative and when it is a full moon, they point their telescopes at many interesting features. During new moon, they find planets and galaxies to look at. Definitely worth the trip.
