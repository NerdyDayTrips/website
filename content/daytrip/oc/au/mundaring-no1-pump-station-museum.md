Explore one of Australia’s most significant industrial heritage sites, a showcase for the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme. 

Commissioned in 1903, No 1 Pump Station at Minderinjy was the first of eight steam pump stations constructed as part of the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme. Designed by CY O’Connor the pipeline traverses a distance of 560 km from the Perth hills to the WA Goldfields to bring precious water to this notoriously dry part of the state.
