Scienceworks is the go-to destination in Melbourne for curious minds of all ages. Explore the interactive exhibitions and experiences to see how science works.

The dedicated area for the younger kids will provide simple fun with a science theme.  Kids pushing tiny wheelbarrows filled with foam bricks is adorable.  Fans blowing scarves through clear tubes!

The planetarium shows are informative and entertaining for a wide range of audiences. Each show runs for 30â€“45 minutes and features a live presentation of the current night sky, highlighting the major astronomical objects visible at the time.

Highlighting each show in the Lightning Theatre is the giant Tesla Coil, capable of generating more than two million volts of electricity to produce three-metre lightning bolts.  This is quite loud, so people with sensitive hearing are offered earplugs.  Take along ear muffs for children with sensitive ears, or be ready to cover their ears with your hands (plenty of warning is provided).

There is an area dedicated to sports science (Sportsworks) which is entirely interactive and should be enough to drain the energy from most youngsters.  Can you outrun Cathy Freeman?

There are exhibits that periodically change, an old Pumping Station to explore, a cafe, an amphitheatre with several daily live shows, playgrounds, and an upstairs level with exhibits that focus on sound and fluid dynamics.
