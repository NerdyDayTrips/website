This abandoned railway tunnel is a highlight along the Railway Reserve Heritage Trail in the Beautiful John Forrest National Park. While the main trail bypasses the tunnel, there is the option to take a short detour and walk through it if you’d like.

Designed by the renowned engineer C.Y. O’Connor, the tunnel was built in 1894 and took over a year to complete. Around 300 workers constructed it using only picks, shovels, and dynamite—an incredibly dangerous job at the time.

The 340-metre-long tunnel was sealed with more than 330,000 bricks and was considered a major engineering achievement of its day. A bypass route was added in 1945 and remained in use until the railway line was closed in 1966.
