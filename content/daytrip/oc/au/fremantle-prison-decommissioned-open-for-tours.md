Step inside Fremantle Prison, Western Australia’s only World Heritage–listed building, and discover its fascinating history. Once a maximum-security gaol, the site is now open for guided tours that bring to life stories of convicts, daring escapes, and daily prison life.

From exploring the vast cell blocks to venturing underground through the tunnels, visitors can experience the prison’s past in an engaging and unforgettable way. The Gatehouse is free to enter, with museum displays and galleries that offer a glimpse into one of the state’s most important heritage sites.
