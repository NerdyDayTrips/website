Gaze at the stars from Western Australia’s oldest observatory, tucked away in the hills of Bickley, just 25 km from Perth.

With more than a century of history, the Perth Observatory blends heritage charm with awe-inspiring night sky experiences. Run today by a passionate volunteer group, it offers stargazing sessions, tours, and stories that connect science, culture, and the cosmos. 

Whether you’re a lifelong astronomy buff or simply want to marvel at the Milky Way, this is one of Perth’s most magical spots for exploring the universe.
