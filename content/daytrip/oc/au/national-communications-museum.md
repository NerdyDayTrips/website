The National Communication Museum (NCM) in Hawthorn is situated in a historic 1930s-era exchange building, parts of which remain operational.

Absolutely suitable for children (and adults suffering nostalgia) with interactive exhibits and displays of technologies from the ancient past (that the adults may remember using).

At the heart of the museum is a heritage telecommunications collection dating back to the 1850s, passionately collected for over 60 years by volunteers across Australia. This collection is presented alongside contemporary technologies and works that explore the development of technologies past, present, and future.  Gaze in wonder as the pre-digital "Speaking Clock" reads the time aloud using only mechanical systems and analogue electronics!

By engaging in conversation, risk-taking, and experimentation, NCM provides a welcoming space for addressing challenging questions in an ever-evolving landscape of technological disruption and change.
