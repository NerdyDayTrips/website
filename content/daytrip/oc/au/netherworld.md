In The Waste Land Of The Valley
Far Beyond Where Brisbane Punters Should Dare Explore…

…lies the Netherworld – a drinking hole, diner, and collection of gaming relics from decades past. Lurking in the shadows beyond, the corner bar crouches over forgotten treasures from the 70s until present day, including 15 pinball machines, 25 arcade machines, classic consoles, and countless board games. The bar wields 24 taps of local beer, cider, and mixed elixirs. The diner serves up a diverse and otherworldly selection of bites, buns, and bowls. Mind the hell mouth and welcome to the other side.
