You get to be your own personal train on real tracks, with 1 or 2 people pedalling.  They push you up the hill so don’t worry.  Volunteer to go up front so you can control the convoy and give commands to the others to stop.  Along the way you’ll learn the history of this railway line, possibly the only train track funded by the Murdoch family.
