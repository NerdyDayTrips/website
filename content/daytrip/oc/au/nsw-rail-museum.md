Go all the way back to the beginning as you walk the timeline of rail development from the invention of the very first steam engine to today, and discover how NSW railways brought life to town and country.

See inside the driver’s cab of an historic steam locomotive, explore a mail van, walk through a prison van and admire the Governor-General’s carriage in all its glory.

Visit the Great Train Hall to see an impressive collection of locomotives, carriages and wagons – each with a unique story to tell.
