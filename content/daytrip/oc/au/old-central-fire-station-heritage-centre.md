Step back in time at Perth’s first purpose-built fire station, now preserved as the Old Central Fire Station Heritage Centre. With more than 125 years of firefighting history on display, the centre showcases vintage fire engines, historic equipment, and colourful stories of life in the brigade. A must-visit for anyone curious about the city’s firefighting past!
