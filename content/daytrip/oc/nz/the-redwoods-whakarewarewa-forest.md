The history and culture surrounding the Whakarewarewa Forest, the variety of outdoor recreational opportunities, diverse range of exotic tree species, mix of native undergrowth, panoramic views, and proximity to lakes, thermal areas and the city centre have made The Redwoods & Whakarewarewa Forest one of Rotorua’s most spectacular natural assets and one of the city’s greatest treasures.

Over 5600 hectares of forest await you to enjoy and explore at your leisure. If you love the outdoors and want to experience nature at its best, this area is definitely for you!

The forest is most well known for the network of superb mountain biking and walking tracks and for the magnificent stand of Californian Coast Redwoods. These towering trees, along with numerous other species and the fresh forest air, combine to create an invigorating atmosphere and a truly unique and special environment.
