The museum is primarily dedicated to Johannes Gutenberg, a native of Mainz and  "Man of the Millennium", who invented printing with movable metal type more than 550 years ago, initiating a media revolution. In addition to comprehensive information about his life, work, and inventions, as well as their reception and consequences, the museum, which was founded in 1900 by citizens of Mainz, presents important aspects of letterpress printing.
