Visitor center at the ESO Headquarters. The astronomy exhibition is open to the public and free, and the Planetarium show often sells out weeks in advance.

Closed on Mondays and Tuesdays, and in case of special events (conferences can also be held at this venue).

There is a lot of information on the homepage; please check the details before you proceed.

They have a room called "The Void". Screaming is not allowed.
