The Enigma Cipher Centre is an extraordinary place – a unique exhibition that engages visitors and presents the story of breaking the Enigma code and the methods of encrypting messages developed over the centuries. It is a mystery and adventure in one.

An open mind and the willingness to test oneself by solving cipher mysteries are important to us. Our visitors will face an intellectual challenge presented in an innovative, multimedia exhibition. It will be an engaging introduction to the tale about the events that changed the Second World War and paved the way for the digital world we live in.
