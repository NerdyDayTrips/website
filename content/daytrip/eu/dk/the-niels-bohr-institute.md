Alledgedly the site of the first of Werner Heisenberg's and Niels Bohr's meetings during the German occupation of Denmark. Heisenberg had come to Copenhagen to discuss the feasibility of an atom bomb with Bohr, his old mentor. Whether he tried to recruit Bohr to the German cause or warn him of developments in the German atom bomb project is still a matter for debate. Bohr and Heisenberg are reported to have gone for a walk in the neighbouring Fælledparken during their talk. 

Note that records are unclear as to the precise number of meetings as well as the location of the each meeting, as Bohr's and Heisenberg's postwar accounts differ. It seems they also met later at Bohr's house in the Carlsberg Honorary Residence which had been bestowed on him by the brewers' foundation in 1932.
