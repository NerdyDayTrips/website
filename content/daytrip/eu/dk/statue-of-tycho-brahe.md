A statue of Tycho Brahe, the Danish astronomer whose observations laid the groundwork for Johannes Kepler's theories of planetary motion.

Note that the statue is looking - with a somewhat haughty expression - in the direction of Rosenborg Castle across the street. Brahe was a favourite of king Frederick II until his (Frederick's) death in 1588. His sucessor, Christian IV who built Rosenborg as a summer estate, forced Brahe into exile and confiscated his lands in his quest to raise funds for building projects.
