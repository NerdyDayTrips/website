The botanical garden is situated on the Lade peninsula, about 3 km east of Trondheim's city centre. The garden is always open and has free entry.

Here, you can enjoy the colourful biodiversity and learn more about trees, traditional medicinal plants, plant evolution and popular ornamental plants.

The plants in the botanical garden are living collections used for research, education, and conservation of endangered species. The garden is about 32 acres and was established by the university in 1973.
