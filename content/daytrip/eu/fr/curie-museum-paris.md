Marie Curie's lab and office are preserved exactly as it was. Some human employees will spend as much time as you want showing you around. Plan on 1 or 2 hours. 

It's free, but please leave a donation! Tells the story of the Curie family of scientists. It's not the easiest place to find, don't follow the signs to the "Curie Lab". It's the opposite direction, located in the Université Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL.

We were on the hop-on/hop-off bus. Got off at the Notre Dame Cathedral and it was a 20-minute walk.
