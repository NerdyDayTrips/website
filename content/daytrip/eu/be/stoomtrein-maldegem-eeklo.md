At Stoomtrein Maldegem-Eeklo, we bring railway history to life. What began as the dream of a few enthusiasts in the 1980s has grown into Flanders’ largest heritage railway collection. Today, our steam and diesel trains once again run along part of the former line 58 between Maldegem and Eeklo – offering a unique experience for visitors of all ages.
