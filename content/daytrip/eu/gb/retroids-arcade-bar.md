Retroids is a bar in Worcester city centre, with classic and modern arcade and pinballs, with a fully stocked bar. Whether you’re a pinball fanatic, looking to relive your childhood favourite games or a complete newbie and just coming for a play about, we’d love to have you visit. 

We’re a local, family run business with father and son team Steve and Dave running the show with the support of our trusty bar Manager Brad and the rest of our friendly bar team.
