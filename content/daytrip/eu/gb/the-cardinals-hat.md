The Cardinal's Hat is a very old pub, claiming to be the oldest in Worcester, another good option for History Nerds. First mentioned in 1497.

Today, it is a friendly and informal pub that serves a great collection of real ales, craft beers, ciders, and more, along with freshly prepared pub snacks. Additionally, it offers 6 boutique city rooms for overnight stays and exploring the historic heart of Worcester City.

Cosy up by the woodburning stoves in our atmospheric bar rooms or enjoy our courtyard seating in our covered beer garden.

The Cardinal's Hat is Worcester's oldest inn, dating back to the fourteenth century. A sensitive restoration in 2013 has turned it back in to a traditional English ale house retaining a wonderful sense of its unique heritage.

A stone’s throw from the Cathedral, The Cardinal’s Hat was one of numerous ecclesiastical inns originally established to accommodate the many travellers and pilgrims who visited Worcester during the Middle Ages.

Nestled in the heart of this venerated city, this time-honoured establishment is aptly situated in Friar Street. A noteworthy locale which gets its name from the Franciscan Friary that once dominated the area from the thirteenth century through to the Henry VIII’s Reformation in the 1530s.
