Three for one! At the top of Cherhill Down is Oldbury Castle -- an Iron-age hill fort. Just below the summit is the Cherhill White Horse, one of the older chalk figures in the country. On the other limb of the hill fort is the Lansdowne Monument, a 19th-century monument to Sir William Petty, surveyor of Ireland for Oliver Cromwell.
