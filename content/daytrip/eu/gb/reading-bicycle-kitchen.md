Reading Bike Kitchen is a not-for-profit community project run entirely by volunteers. Founded in 2014, our mission is to support the local community by ensuring that cycling is accessible to all. We achieve this by providing low-cost bike repairs, bike refurbishing & rehoming, bike donations to local causes and free bike maintenance courses.
