The large Obelisk in Trent Park was brought from Wrest Park by Sir Philip Sassoon in 1934 in order to impress the Duke and Duchess of Kent, honeymooning at the estate. A channel was carved through the forest to afford a grand view of the monument from Trent Park House.
As well as a nice location for a walk, nerds may appreciate that this featured in the Doctor Who episode "Mawdryn Undead" https://www.doctorwholocations.net/locations/trentparkobelisk
