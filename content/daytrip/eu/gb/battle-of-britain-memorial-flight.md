The Battle of Britain Memorial Flight is a selection of Second World War aircraft, including one of only two airworthy Lancaster bombers remaining, Spitfires, and Hurricanes. It's often possible to tour the hangar, and in the summer, you can see the old aircraft flying around the local area. These are the aircraft frequently spotted doing fly-pasts on occasions in London.
