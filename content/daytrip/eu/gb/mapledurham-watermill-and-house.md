Mapledurham Watermill is a working 15th Century water mill on the north bank of the Thames near Reading. As well as the mill and mill machinery itself, there is an Archimedes screw hydroelectric power station driven from the same millpond as the mill. The mill building has also been used as a filming location, most notably in the film The Eagle Has Landed.

Mapledurham House was originally built in the 16th Century, and contains several priest holes.

Access is only via pre-booked tours of the house and mill (see website).
