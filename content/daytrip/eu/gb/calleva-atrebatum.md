An Iron-age and Roman town, uninhabited since the seventh century CE. Little remains now, except for the (well-preserved) walls and the amphitheatre on the east side of the town.

A decade-long series of excavations were recently made by the University of Reading Archaeology Department, and they have a website all about [the history of the town, and their findings](https://research.reading.ac.uk/silchester/)
