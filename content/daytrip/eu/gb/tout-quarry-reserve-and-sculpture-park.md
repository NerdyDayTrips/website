This former quarry is now a nature reserve and contains over 60 sculptures hewn from the large rocks left abandoned in the quarry. Free parking and entry, this is a lovely place to stroll around, and explore further and you will be presented with stunning views of the mainland and chesil beach. Kids and dogs enjoy it too.
