A substantial collection of wartime artifacts to wander around and explore. Items range from large (planes, cannons, anti-aircraft guns) to small (medals, ration books, etc). Often arranged in dioramas at an old RAF airfield, this is a labour of love, and something a bit different, and a chance to get up-close to many items.
