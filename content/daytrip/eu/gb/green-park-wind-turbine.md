Visible to anyone passing through Reading on the M4, the townâ€™s first windmill was built in 2005 under our Merchant Wind Power scheme to provide energy for the office buildings at Green Park. Bringing wind power into urban areas people can witness for themselves how clean, quiet and efficient it is.
