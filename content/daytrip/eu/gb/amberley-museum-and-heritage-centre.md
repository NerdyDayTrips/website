A museum located in a disused chalk quarry. As well as old chalk kilns, they have collected a lot of equipment and buildings from around the country and have things like a 1950s fire station complete with fire engines, a 1930s roadside cafe, a working 1940s telephone exchange which visitors can operate, a room full of printing presses and a level crossing signal box.
