A really nice old small pub in centre of Worcester for History nerds to enjoy. 

The King Charles House is one of the oldest and most significant buildings in Worcester with its origins dating all the way back to 1500's. The building is most famous for aiding King Charles' escape from Cromwell's forces during the Civil War and its oubliette, which has a story or two to tell.

The King Charles House has a unique and unusual claim to fame as it is the place that King Charles II fled from in fear of his life. This occurred subsequently from his defeat during the Battle of Worcester, the final battle of the English Civil War.
