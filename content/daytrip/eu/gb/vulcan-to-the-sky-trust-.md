Robin Hood Airport is the home of XH558, the last Avro Vulcan to fly. Known for its distinctive howl and delta wing, the Vulcan was the most iconic of the British V-bombers and had a long career with the RAF before finally seeing action in the Falklands War in 1982.

After it's 'retirement' in 1984, XH558 few with the RAF's Vulcan Display Flight until 1999 and, after major restoration, it flew again from 2007. XH558 stunned crowds at air shows for many years until it's last flight in 2015.

Also on site is a fine example of another Cold War warrior, the English Electric Canberra.
