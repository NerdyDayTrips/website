A piece of public art by Sioban Coppinger celebrating Thomas Attwood, Birmingham reformer and politician. It's a little hidden on the steps behind the Town Hall in Chamberlain Square. Attwood lounges on the steps in bronze, while around him are pages reflecting causes he championed: Votes For All, Reform, Full Employment.
