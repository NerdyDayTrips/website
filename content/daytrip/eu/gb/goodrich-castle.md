A lovely walk from the car park to the castle itself. 

The castle is absolutely worth a visit. Very imposing building with a wide and deep (now empty) moat.

When I went there was a person in character & costime telling little kids some stories about the lineage of people who owned the place.

I think I enjoyed that more than the kids.
