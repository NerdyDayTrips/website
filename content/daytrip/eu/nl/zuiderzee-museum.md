Museum about life at the shores of the Zuiderzee. In 1932 the great IJsselmeer barrier dam was constructed and the Zuiderzee was separated form the Waddenzee. While the Zuiderzee was in open connection with the (salt) sea before, now it became a fresh water lake. The museum is about life before 1932 in the historic village, but also focusses on the current situation and future.

Can be combined with the steam tram from Hoorn to Medemblik by taking the historic ferry "Friesland", which sails between Medemblik and Enkhuizen.
