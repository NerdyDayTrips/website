Located on an artificial island that served as a construction base during the construction of the Oosterschelde barrier, Neeltje Jans is now a visitor center and theme park centered on the Delta Works that protect the Netherlands form the sea. The construction of the Delta works started after the flooding of Zeeland in 1953. Besides exhibitions the park also has a playground, storm simulator and marine wildlife.
