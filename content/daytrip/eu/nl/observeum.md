This museum combines a observatory (started with a local farmer's hobby)
with a museum that covers seemingly unrelated subjects but still does each justice.
Expositions range from Archeology, Geology, 19th century people and culture and the ingenious sailing boats invented by a local hairdresser, Hendrik Bulthuis.
He spread the designs for free, allowing a large number of people to own a sailing boat for the first time.
