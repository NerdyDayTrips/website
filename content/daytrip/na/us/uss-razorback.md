Ever wanted to actually walk through a 1940's era submarine?  This is the WWII submarine USS Razorback which is is the longest serving combat front line submarine existing in the world today (50+ years).  After being retired from US service it was used by a few other countries and then came back to the US to serve as a museum piece.  It's actually still docked & floating in the river.  There are multiple tours per day where you climb down the ladder and get to see just what it was like to live in one of these for months at a time.  The staff is actually 90% of the way through a complete rebuild to get it fully operational, and really enthusiastic to chat; I talked with our guide for 20 minutes afterwards about various bits of their technology they were using back then.
