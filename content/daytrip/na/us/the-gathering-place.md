This is a city park that's a destination! It has AMAZING playground areas for kids of all abilities, a quiet sensory park area for those needing a break from stimulation, a 'slide park' for all ages, pond with sandy beach or docks for sitting, walking trails, beautiful views from the various buildings, basketball courts, connected to the cities running trail system, and when in season there are kayaks and canoes for boating on the pond!

Amazing light displays for the Christmas season!
