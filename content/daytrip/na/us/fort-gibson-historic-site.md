This historic fort was originally founded to keep the peace between the Native American Osage and Cherokee tribes, supported the expansion to the west, and was even reactivated and used by Union forces during the Civil War.

There are occasional living history events at the site, so check their calendar to align with offerings when you plan your trip!

Admission is $10/adult with kids free, discounts for elderly
