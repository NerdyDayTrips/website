The International UFO Museum and Research Center in Roswell, New Mexico, is often described as "nerdy" because it focuses heavily on a deep, academic-style dive into the details of UFO phenomena. Rather than being a flashy, high-tech attraction, it relies on a large collection of reading materials, including witness statements, newspaper clippings, and extensive written exhibits. The museum also has a large research library with over 7,000 books and thousands of magazines and periodicals, catering to visitors who want to spend time conducting in-depth research. This focus on detailed documentation and research appeals to serious UFO enthusiasts and researchers, which contributes to its "nerdy" reputation.
