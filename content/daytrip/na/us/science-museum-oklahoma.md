Amazing and HUGE science museum for kids and adults alike, My kids have been here several times and are always excited to go back. They add new exhibits occasionally, but also have some that were there in the 19080's when I was a kid that my kids still enjoy. My son's favorite thing is the 'Explosion Show' in the auditorium where they... well make explosions! My daughter loves the hall of mirrors and a lot of the hands on exhibits.

In addition to the science side, there is a train inside that can be reserved for parties (Pullman cars I think...), and there is an entire side for space and aerospace with real airplanes, rocket engine, etc; as well as a mock lunar lander module.

If you have a museum membership somewhere else, check their affiliate program - you might be eligible for discounted or free admission!

A definite kid favorite!
