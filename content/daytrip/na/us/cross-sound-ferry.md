This ferry from New London, CT or Orient Point on Long Island is just a ferry.

The nerdy draw is that it passes by Plum Island, home of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center, also called "Anthrax Island".  It was featured in the movie "Silence of the Lambs" as the place where they might keep Hannibal Lecter if they were to ever let him out of his prison cell.

The island itself is off-limits to the public.
