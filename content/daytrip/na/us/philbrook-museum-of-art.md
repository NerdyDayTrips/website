The museum houses an impressive collection of art from around the world and acres of immaculately maintained gardens and walking paths.

Tour the galleries for the art and head to the gardens for a walk or picnic.

Many public events including some specifically geared towards children. Of course they have rotating special exhibits, and their Christmas lights are amazing!
