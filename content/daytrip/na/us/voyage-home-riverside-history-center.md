From the website: "The Voyage Home History Center showcases Riverside's past, present, and future. It is a blend of historical city displays and Star Trek memorabilia to celebrate its official designation as the Future Birthplace of Captain James T Kirk!"

What would otherwise be a pleasant but nondescript town in rural Iowa is instead a shrine to all things Trek. With a serious focus on TOS and it's captain.  The last weekend in June is TrekFest and you can get all the details at https://trekfest.org
