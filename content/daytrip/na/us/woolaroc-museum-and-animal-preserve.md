A historic ranch built by oil magnate Frank Philips, which through his life and since has been developed as both a museum complex and animal preserve.

The museum includes many Native American and Western artifacts, including objects, textiles, statues, and paintings.

The animal preserve includes a sizable bison herd.

A snippet from their website's history detail:
Envisioning the Woolaroc Museum as a symbol of his commitment to the community and the youth of America, Uncle Frank wrote this dedication in 1944, six years before his death:

“Those of us who have been more fortunate have a debt to society, which I believe can best be paid by training and educating the youth of the nation. I dedicate this museum to the boys and girls of today, the fathers and mothers of tomorrow. May they profit by a knowledge of man’s past and be enabled to plan and live a happier future.”

That dedication has stood the test of time. Our mission today remains much the same as Frank envisioned it — and we wouldn’t have it any other way. Woolaroc is committed to preserving the heritage of the people of Oklahoma and the values of early America that made this country great.
