Tours show the processes of drilling and blasting to the processing of the ore with a ¼ mile underground walking adventure into the 4th oldest mine in the country and the last working underground mine in NJ. Along the way you will see a mining equipment history display, a drilling and blasting demonstration and the world famous fluorescent “Rainbow Tunnel” where everybody gets to take home a fluorescent mineral specimen.
