The Mill Ends Park has been designated the smallest park in the world by the Guinness Book of Records.  It is a tiny square, maintained by the city of Portland, Oregon, located in a median strip on Southwest Naito Parkway, near S.W. Taylor Street.  It was dedicated in 1948 and became an official park in 1976. Its total area is 452 square inches.

        The photo is of the park in summer. In the autumn the flowers die back and occasionally a brightly colored leaf from a nearby tree will drop into the park.
