The Tulsa Air and Space Museum has exhibits ranging from early flight through the modern era. There are also hands on exhibits that the kids love like a hot air balloon simulator, remote controlled hobby aircraft and helicopter simulator, open cockpits kids can sit in, an American Airlines MD-80 retired passenger plane, and more including an onsite planetarium with regular showings.

The museum also hosts fly-ins from groups such as the CAF who bring in various historic craft such as B-17, B-28, B-29, P-51, and a few others. These special events do have a slightly higher admission price, but touring these old craft is more than worth it!

The museum brings the love of aeronautics to kids and adults alike!
