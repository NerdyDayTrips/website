I honestly wasn&rsquo;t expecting quite this level of activity on <a href=nerdydaytrips.org>nerdydaytrips.org</a> when I last <a href=https://nerdydaytrips.org/blog/2025/06/nerdy-day-trips-podcast-appearance/>posted</a> on earlier in the month. Turns out when you give nerds a map and ask them to add their favourite geeky destinations, they really go for it. Who knew?</p><h3 id=the-numbers-game>The Numbers Game</h3><p>Let&rsquo;s dive into the stats, because I know at least three of you reading this will appreciate them:</p><p>Since June 11th:</p><ul><li><strong>185</strong> new places added</li><li><strong>25</strong> locations removed (mostly because someone&rsquo;s idea of &ldquo;nerdy&rdquo; was a bit&mldr; loose)</li><li><strong>250</strong> edits to existing locations - people actually care about getting the details right</li><li>Around <strong>20</strong> code tweaks to keep the site from falling over</li><li><strong>25</strong> new issues raised, with <strong>20</strong> already sorted</li></ul><p>Not bad for a side project that started as &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if&mldr;&rdquo;</p><h3 id=heroes-of-the-spreadsheet>Heroes of the Spreadsheet</h3><p>I need to properly thank some folks who&rsquo;ve been putting in serious work while I&rsquo;ve been tinkering with other things.</p><p><strong>Hugo Mills (darkling)</strong> has been an absolute legend. He&rsquo;s methodically working through all the pre-2016 entries - you know, the ones I hastily imported without much quality control - and actually checking they&rsquo;re still relevant and accurate. It&rsquo;s the kind of tedious but essential work that makes the difference between a useful resource and a digital graveyard. Cheers, Hugo!</p><p><strong>Stuart Langridge</strong> has been fixing my dodgy code and adding genuinely useful features. The latest one makes sure the &ldquo;Add a Place&rdquo; page remembers where you were looking on the main map, which is one of those obvious-in-retrospect improvements that I should have thought of ages ago.</p><p>Big thanks too to <strong>andibing</strong>, <strong>mcphail</strong>, and <strong>debb1046</strong> for their steady stream of contributions, and to all those on <a href=https://github.com/NerdyDayTrips>GitHub</a> for actually bothering to report bugs instead of just tutting and moving on.</p><h3 id=whats-actually-new>What&rsquo;s Actually New</h3><p>We&rsquo;ve got some properly interesting additions to the map now. The <a href=https://nerdydaytrips.org/daytrip/eu/nl/blender-institute/>Blender Institute</a> in Amsterdam, the <a href=https://nerdydaytrips.org/daytrip/na/us/great-lakes-science-center/>Great Lakes Science Center</a>, and the <a href=https://nerdydaytrips.org//daytrip/na/us/national-museum-of-the-us-air-force/>National Museum of the U.S. Air Force</a> are just a few of the gems people have shared. It&rsquo;s fascinating to see what different folks consider worth a nerdy pilgrimage. It&rsquo;s also wonderful to see the names and locations of museums, heritage sites, and good old steam trains, all over the world!</p><p>On the technical side, we&rsquo;ve squashed some encoding bugs that were making markers vanish (always embarrassing when your map loses bits of itself), and made the mobile experience less of a finger-gymnastics exercise.</p><p>It&rsquo;s been a genuinely encouraging couple of weeks. The site feels like it&rsquo;s finding its feet, and having actual humans contribute makes it infinitely better than anything I could cobble together on my own.</p><p>Keep those submissions coming!</p><hr><a href=https://github.com/nerdydaytrips/website/edit/main/content/blog/2025/06/surprisingly-productive-chaos.md rel=external><i class='fa-solid fa-pen-to-square'>&nbsp;</i>Edit on GitHub</a></article><hr><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=../../../../website/pr-1656/blog/2025/06/nerdy-day-trips-podcast-appearance/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nerdy Day Trips Podcast Appearance">&larr; Previous post</a></li></ul></main><footer id=footer></footer></body><script src=https://kit.fontawesome.com/06412a75a5.js crossorigin=anonymous></script></html>
